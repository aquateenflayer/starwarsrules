		NAME:"Basic",
		DESCRIPTION:"Galactic Basic, also known as Basic, or galactic standard, was the name of the most prevalent language in the galaxy. It was spoken by species including—but not limited to—the humans and the Pantorans, but not by the Ewoks and the Talz. The Gungans of Naboo spoke a heavily accented dialect of Basic, with many differences in grammar and vocabulary.\nMost stormtroopers, the elite soldiers of the Galactic Empire, could only speak and understand Basic, despite the commonness of other languages such as Huttese. With vocal cords that were quite different from those of many other species, Wookiees and Ithorians were entirely unable to speak Basic, though they could learn to understand it. Ithorians used translators to simulate speaking Basic. Tasu Leech, leader of the Kanjiklub, would never desire to speak Basic, which he dismissed as a \"soft language for soft people.\""
