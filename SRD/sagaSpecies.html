  <a name="bothan"></a>
  <h1 class="species">Bothans</h1>
  <img src="pictures/bothan.jpg">
  <p>Native to Bothawui, these short, fur-covered humanoids have had hyperspace travel for thousands of years. Bothans use information as a measure of wealth and power, even wielding it as a weapon when necessary. The Bothan SpyNet, one of the largest intelligence agencies during most eras, plays an important role in the Galactic Civil War.</p>

<p>Culturally, Bothans don't believe in direct conflict because it destroys people, material, and even information. They prefer behind-the-scenes manipulation, watching and waiting for information that they can use to gain status and influence. This attitude makes espionage a natural part of their culture. While others often find Bothans to be manipulative and irritating, no one wants to lose access to their SpyNet. As a result, nearly all groups have at least some contact with the Bothans.</p>
<hr width = "25%">
<h3>Bothan Characteristics </h3>
<p><b>Personality:</b> Bothans are curious, manipulative, crafty, suspicious, and even a bit paranoid. They can be irritating, but they are also loyal and brave.</p>

<p><b>Physical Description:</b> Bothans are covered with fur that ripples in response to their emotional state. They have tapered ears, and both male and female Bothans sport beards. They average about 1.6 meters tall and have a maturity rate and life span slightly greater than Humans.</p>

<p><b>Average Height/Weight:</b> The typical Bothan stands at 1.6 meters in height, and averages at 55 kilograms in weight.
Homeworld: The industrial world of Bothawui is the birthplace of the Bothans, along with various colony worlds throughout The Mid Rim territories.</p>
<p><b>Languages:</b> Bothans speak, read, and write both Bothese and Basic.</p>

<p><b>Example Names:</b> Borsk Fey'lya, Karka Kre'fey, Koth Melan, Tav Breil'lya, Tereb Ab'lon.</p>

<p><b>Adventurers:</b> Bothan adventures, often SpyNet operatives, engage in daring missions at great personal risk. In addition, many Bothan heroes serve as Soldiers, Scoundrels, and Nobles. Their curiosity leads some to be explorers and Scouts.</p>
<hr width = "25%">
<h3>Bothan Species Traits </h3>
<p>Bothans share the following species traits:</p>

<p><b>&bull;Ability Modifiers:</b> Bothans have a +2 bonus to their Dexterity, and a -2 penalty to their Constitution. Bothans are agile but not particularly resilient.</p>

<p><b>&bull;Automatic Languages:</b> All Bothans can speak, read, and write both Basic and Bothese.</p>

  <p>Cereans are a sophisticated and cultured humanoid Species native to Cerea, a world on the fringes of known space. Their elongated heads distinguish the, from most other humanoid Species.</p>

<p>Cereans established contact with the rest of the galaxy shortly before the Galactic Republic was transformed into the Empire, swiftly gaining fame as expert astrogators, cryptographers, and economists. Few patterns or trends escape the notice of a Cerean.</p>

<p>Cerean society is matriarchal, and the Cerean culture's traditional values emphasize living in harmony with nature and minimizing any impact on the environment from technology. The peaceful philosophies of The Jedi appeal to Cereals, and many join the Order.</p>
<hr width = "25%">
<h3>Cerean Characteristics </h3>
<b>Personality:</b> Cereans tend to be calm, rational, and extremely logical.</p>

<p><b>Adventurers:</b> Cereans who become adventurers do so in spite of their peaceful traditions. Still, when a cause or situation leads down this path, a Cerean tries to keep these traditions intact, avoiding aggression when possible.</p> <p>The binary brain allows a Cerean to constantly weigh both sides in any disagreement and give two points of view equal consideration. This ability extends even to issues surrounding The Force, and a Cerean Jedi or Force Prodigy often contemplates the Light Side and the Dark Side simultaneously.</p>

<p>&bull;<b>Automatic Languages:</b> All Cereans can speak, read, and write both Basic and Cerean.</p>

  <h1 class="species">Duros</h1>
  <img src="pictures/duros.jpg">
  Tall, hairless humanoids from the Duro System, Duros were one of the first Species to become a major influence in the Galactic Republic, and many respected scholars credited the Duros with creating the first hyperdrive. The Duros have a natural affinity for space travel, possessing an innate grasp of the mathematical underpinnings of astrogational computations. Many tales are swapped in cantinas about Duros astrogators calculating the coordinates for supposedly impossible jumps in their heads. Although not as numerous as Humans, the Duros are almost as omnipresent; all but the smallest settlements in known space feature Duros populations.<br>
  The Duros Species has existed on other worlds in isolation from the rest of their kind, evolving in slight different directions from the baseline Species. The most populous and well-known near-Duros Species are the Neimoidians, a people rarely encountered during the Rebellion era.<br>

<p>Intelligent omnivores native to one of the moons orbiting Endor, Ewoks are almost unknown prior to the battle of Endor. Ewoks live in tree-dwelling tribes with gender-based division of labor; males hunt, forage, and make weapons, while females raise young and handle other domestic tasks. Ewok culture revolves around complex animistic beliefs involving the giant trees of the forest moon.</p>

  <h1 class="species">Gamorreans</h1>
  <img src="pictures/gamorrean.jpg">
 <p> Gamorreans are green-skinned, porcine creatures native to Gamorr. Their tendency toward violence makes them valued as criminal enforcers; though viewed as mindless brutes, they don't care so long as they are paid to fight.</p>

<p>Gamorrean civilization revolves around the never-ending wars between their clans. Preferring large melee weapon in combat, many see ranged weapons as cowardly. Males live to fight; females farm, hunt, and manufacture weapons. Inter-clan hatred rarely fades, and anyone hiring Gamorreans should be aware of their clans to avoid infighting.</p>

  Wookiees are widely recognized as one of the strongest and fiercest intelligent Species in the galaxy. Wookiees have many customs and traditions that revolve around honor and loyalty, including the special bond called the honor family and the sacred pledge called the Life Debt.

A fit of Rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the Wookiee's Constitution modifier. At the end of it's Rage, the Wookiee moves -1 Persistent step along the Condition Track.

    <img src="pictures/Neimoidian.jpg">
    <p>Neimoidians descend from a group of Duros colonists that, during the earliest period of their Species' exploration of space, venture far beyond the edge of regions considered possible to settle. These colonists exist in isolation for thousands of years, in the small cluster of stars from which they draw their name. When contact was reestablished by the Twelfth Alderaanian Expedition, the expedition discovers a unique civilization that has spread to a dozen planets and is based around trade and conspicuous consumption.</p>

<p>The Neimoidians quickly find a place in galactic civilization, excited by the prospect of markets beyond their own worlds. For several centuries, they are among the leading forces behind the construction of new starports and the upgrade of existing ones. They trade with everyone- Republic or Sith, Hutt or Herglic-because to the Neimoidians, all that matters is a market for their goods. They help found the Trade Federation, a cartel of mercantile interests that, driven by Neimoidian greed, becomes so powerful that it threatens the very interstellar commerce it exists to protect. When the organization attempts to become the sole conduit for trade in certain parts of space, the Senate and the Jedi intervene. The Trade Federation is shattered, and Neimoidians see the wealth and galactic authority they accumulated over centuries evaporate within a few short years.</p>

<p>Neimoidian leaders then make the decision to ally with the Separatist movement led by renegade Jedi Count Dooku, which results in the complete dismantling of everything they had built beyond their home systems. For the entire period of the Galactic Empire, Neimoidian starports are under heavy Imperial control, and any efforts they make to reestablish their once-mighty trade networks are undermined at every turn.</p>

<p>As a result, Neimoidian society turns inward in a self-imposed isolation that is as total as any they experienced during the millennia they spent as a "Lost Duros Colony." The Neimoidians remain isolationists through the Legacy era, and the few Neimoidians that wander beyond their home space are usually on the run from enemies at home and passing themselves off as Duros.</p>

<h3>Neimoidian Characteristics</h3>
<P><b>Personality:</b> Neimoidians are greedy and cowardly, always striving to acquire just one more credit but trying to make sure that someone else takes whatever risks are associated with getting it. Any agreements or promises they make are always full of loopholes and caveats, since Neimoidians never want to suffer the embarrassment of a bad deal or risk being unable to predict every eventuality. Neimoidians want to appear cunning and as if they are the intellectual masters of every situation they encounter, but they typically are just conniving and devious.</p>

<p>Neimoidians hate manual labor and physical activity, viewing such actions as tasks for underlings. They are very fond of mechanical equipment that does work for them and they are enthralled by labor-saving devices of all kinds. Droids are especially popular among Neimoidians.</p>

<p><b>Physical Description:</b> Neimoidians are slight of build and stand between 1.6 and 2 meters in height. They are hairless, with large red eyes and wide, lipless mouths. Their skin is usually bluish gray, but it can range in tone from very pale to almost black. Neimoidians favor expensive clothing and are always seen in public wearing whatever symbols of office or rank they possess.</p>

<p><b>Average Height/Weight:</b> A typical Neimoidian stands at 1.9 meters tall and weighs 70 kilograms.</p>

<p><b>Homeworld:</b> Neimoidians hail from a cluster of planets in the far reaches of The Colonies; the humid world of Neimoidia is their main home.</p>

<p><b>Languages:</b> Neimoidians speak, read, and write their language known as Neimoidian, as well as Basic and Durese.</p>

<p><b>Example Names:</b> Daultay Dofine, Hath Monchar, Jurnel Arrant, Kund Ekorr, Lott Dod, Lufa Danak, Nute Gunray, Rune Haako, Tey How.</p>

<p><b>Adventurers:</b> Prior to the rise of the Empire, Neimoidian adventurers tend to be political leaders or merchants who have fallen on hard times and struggle to regain their former status by working as blackmailers or informants. In later eras, Neimoidian adventurers are dedicated professionals who work in a range of occupations requiring the underhanded double-dealings at which they excel, such as trade negotiator, diplomat, debt collector, private investigator, and corporate spy. Regardless of occupation, Neimoidian adventurers are usually Nobles or Scoundrels.</p>
