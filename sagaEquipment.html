Shockboxing Gloves protect the wearers hands and also deal damage to any character hit by them. Shockboxing Gloves are similar to a Stunning Gauntlet. However, unlike a Stunning Gauntlet, Shockboxing Gloves have various settings, from lethal to a light shock (For sparring) as well as a Stun Setting. Shockboxing Gloves provide a +1 bonus to damage with a successful Unarmed attack. They can be set to Stun as a Swift Action, converting the wearers Unarmed damage to Stun damage (And providing the +1 bonus to Stun damage). Shockboxing Gloves are two sizes smaller than their wearer (For example, a pair of Shockboxing Gloves designed for a Human are Tiny).

Fast and cruel, the Shock Whip is the chosen Weapon of the Mistryl Shadow Guards and is also used by Sith Lord Darth Maleval. A Shock Whip consists of a metal grip from which extend long, thick wires woven together into a single strand. The metal grip houses an Energy Cell that can send a surge of energy through the Shock Whip's cord, issuing an electric shock to the target.</p>

      <p>A Shock Whip is a Melee Weapon with a reach of 2 squares. When you hit with a Shock Whip, the target takes normal damage from the Weapon. Also on a hit, you can choose to make a Grab attack (As a Free Action) against the target using the whip, provided the target is no more than one size category larger than you. Unlike a normal Grab attack, you make a second attack roll at the normal attack bonus with the Shock Whip, and you do not take a -5 penalty on the attack roll. If this second attack roll hits, the target is Grabbed. As a Swift Action once per turn, you can automatically deal 2d6 energy damage to a target Grabbed by the Shock Whip (No additional attack roll required).</p>

      <p>If you have the Trip Feat, you can choose to use the Shock Whip to knock the target Prone instead of making a Grab attack.</p>

Even if you used the Rifle to make a ranged attack on your last turn, you still threaten squares within your reach as long as your Rifle has a mounted Stun Bayonet and you can use it to make Attacks of Opportunity. A Stun Bayonet requires two hands to use when mounted on a Rifle.

      A Stun Bayonet cannot be used when mounted on a Rifle with a folded Retractable Stock. A Stun Bayonet detached from a Rifle functions as a Stun Baton of the same size (Medium); a mounted Stun Bayonet deals more damage than a Stun Baton because of the added leverage and bulk. Because of its implementation into military and police organizations, characters with the Martial Arts I Feat and that are proficient with Rifles treat a Stun Bayonet as a Simple Weapon (Melee) when mounted.

Energy Lances once were commonly carried by honor guards and ceremonial troops such as the Mon Calamari Knights, and many such Weapons still in circulation bear signs of their once-proud heritage. Though an Energy Lance is a Large Weapon, it is balanced in such a way that a Medium creature Trained in the Ride Skill can wield it in one hand while mounted. If an Energy Lance is wielded by a Medium creature that is not mounted, attacks with the Weapon take a -1 penalty.

      The electromagnetic pulse can also be channeled along the length of the lance and fired from the tip as a bolt of plasma. When used in this way, the Energy Lance functions as a Blaster Carbine with no Stun Setting. This use of the Energy Lance requires a Power Pack, and has the same ammunition capacity as a Blaster Carbine.

This results in a weapon that can smash through armored plates or solid rock. Power Hammer were originally used by asteroid miners. They became popular melee weapons after a few conflicts early in the history of the Empire when mining companies found their possessions claimed by the Empire, and the miners fought back.
